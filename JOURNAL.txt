Use PHP to call an external program and then display the results.

The mongoose program is a lightweight and no-installation-required 
webserver which serves the files in the current directory it is in.
http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/

First, startup mongoose by

./mongoose

It will (by default) serve documents on port 8080

From a browser you can type:

http://localhost:8080/
